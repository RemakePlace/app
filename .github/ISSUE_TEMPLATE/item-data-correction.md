 [ITEM NAME HERE]

 
**In-Game Float Height:** 
> Use BDTH to acquire the units for this or simply state yes if you are aware of a float height but unsure of the value. Do not measure this near walls or stairs.

**Acts as a wall:** 
> This is for items like the Stone Partition, which wall items will snap onto. Indicate if the snapping is on a particular face or universal.

**Wall-snapping:**
> Does the item snap onto walls?

**Default Dye Color:**
> Compare the dye options to terebinth to find the default dye in use or indicate that the item is undyeable.
